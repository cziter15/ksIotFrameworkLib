# Tutorials
Before using ksIotFrameworkLib, ensure you are familiar with PlatformIO and have the correct IDE setup.

## IDE Preparation

**When using PlatformIO, no additional setup is required, and you don't need to install the Arduino IDE separately. This library can be used with the Arduino IDE, though it may be suboptimal.**

- [Download and install official Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). PlatformIO IDE is built on top of it.
- Open the extension manager.
- Search for the official `platformio ide` extension.
- Install PlatformIO IDE extension.

## Opening existing projects
- If properly configured, the project should contain a `platformio.ini` file in its main directory.
- To open a project, use the `Open Folder` option from the File menu.
- Dependencies will be automatically installed, which may take some time.
