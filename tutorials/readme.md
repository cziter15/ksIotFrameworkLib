**If using PlatformIO, there is no additional setup. You don't have to install Arduino IDE separately.**

- [Download and install official Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). PlatformIO IDE is built on top of it.
- Open VSCode Package Manager.
- Search for the official `platformio ide` extension.
- Install PlatformIO IDE.

## Opening existing projects
- If properly configured, the project should contain `platformio.ini` file in it's main directory.
- To open a project, just use `Open folder` option from `File` menu.
- Dependences will be automatically installed and it can take some time.
