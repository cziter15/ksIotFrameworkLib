# Quick Reference: Performance Bottlenecks Summary

This document provides a quick reference guide summarizing performance bottlenecks identified through static code analysis of the ksIotFrameworkLib framework.

## Top 10 Bottlenecks (Prioritized)

### ðŸ”´ High Impact (Fix These First)

1. **Forced 1ms delay in app rotator** (Issue 1.2.1)
   - **Impact:** Reduces max loop frequency to 1000 Hz
   - **Fix:** Remove delay or use yield() instead
   - **Estimated gain:** Significantly improved responsiveness

2. **String allocations in MQTT message handler** (Issue 2.2.2)
   - **Impact:** Memory allocations in hot path
   - **Fix:** Pre-allocate strings, use string_view more
   - **Estimated gain:** 15-25% for MQTT-heavy apps

3. **Linear component iteration with poor cache locality** (Issue 1.1.2)
   - **Impact:** O(n) processing of all components every loop
   - **Fix:** Use std::vector instead of std::list
   - **Estimated gain:** 20-40% for apps with 10+ components

4. **Unnecessary updateDeviceUptime() calls** (Issue 1.1.1)
   - **Impact:** Called every loop iteration unnecessarily
   - **Fix:** Move to lazy evaluation in millis64()
   - **Estimated gain:** 5-10% reduction in loop overhead

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Impact (Worth Considering)

5. **MQTT domain resolver processed when connected** (Issue 2.2.1)
   - **Impact:** Wasted processing in common case
   - **Fix:** Early return when connected
   - **Estimated gain:** 10-15% in MQTT component

6. **Component lookup with RTTI linear search** (Issue 3.1.1)
   - **Impact:** O(n) search every time components are found
   - **Fix:** Cache lookups by type
   - **Estimated gain:** 5-10% if called frequently

7. **Device portal checks all services every loop** (Issue 2.3.1)
   - **Impact:** Multiple library calls per iteration
   - **Fix:** Time-slice service checks
   - **Estimated gain:** 10-20% improvement possible

8. **Shared pointer atomic reference counting** (Issue 4.1)
   - **Impact:** Overhead from atomic operations
   - **Fix:** Use unique_ptr where possible
   - **Estimated gain:** 5-15% (requires architectural changes)

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Impact (Minor Optimizations)

9. **WiFi IP check every second when connected** (Issue 2.1.1)
   - **Impact:** Minor system call overhead
   - **Fix:** Only check on state transitions
   - **Estimated gain:** <5% in WiFi component

10. **Switch statement in component loop** (Issue 1.1.3)
    - **Impact:** Branch prediction overhead
    - **Fix:** Fast-path check for Active state
    - **Estimated gain:** <5% improvement

## Architecture Recommendations

### Should Consider
- **std::vector vs std::list** for components storage
- **Component scheduling** strategies (skip patterns, frequency-based)
- **Logging optimization** (reserve capacity, formatting)

### Worth Researching
- Time-slicing for less critical components
- Component execution profiling hooks
- Performance monitoring infrastructure

## Quick Wins Checklist

If you need to optimize quickly, start with:

- [ ] Remove or reduce the 1ms delay in app rotator
- [ ] Pre-allocate strings in MQTT logging
- [ ] Add early returns in MQTT connector when connected
- [ ] Move updateDeviceUptime() to lazy evaluation

These changes require minimal code modifications but provide measurable benefits.

## When to Optimize

Consider optimization if your application has:
- âœ“ Very fast loop requirements (>10 kHz)
- âœ“ Many components (>20)
- âœ“ High MQTT message throughput (>100 msg/sec)
- âœ“ Complex web portal interactions
- âœ“ Real-time responsiveness requirements

For typical IoT applications with 5-10 components, the current implementation is sufficient.

## Testing Strategy

Before optimizing:
1. Add performance counters to measure current state
2. Create benchmark applications
3. Test on target hardware (ESP32/ESP8266)
4. A/B test each optimization
