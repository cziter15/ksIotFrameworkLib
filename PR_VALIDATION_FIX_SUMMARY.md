# PR Title Validation Fix Summary

## Problem Statement

The PR title validation workflow was not properly enforcing Conventional Commits specification, allowing non-compliant PR titles to pass validation.

## Bugs Identified

### 1. Single-character descriptions accepted
- ❌ Before: `feat: a` → **PASSED** (should fail)
- ✅ After: `feat: a` → **FAILED** (correctly)

### 2. Multiple spaces after colon accepted
- ❌ Before: `feat:  description` → **PASSED** (should fail)
- ✅ After: `feat:  description` → **FAILED** (correctly)

### 3. Scopes with spaces/special chars accepted
- ❌ Before: `feat(bad scope): desc` → **PASSED** (should fail)
- ✅ After: `feat(bad scope): desc` → **FAILED** (correctly)

### 4. Uppercase descriptions accepted
- ❌ Before: `feat: Add feature` → **PASSED** (should fail)
- ✅ After: `feat: Add feature` → **FAILED** (correctly)

### 5. Uppercase scopes accepted
- ❌ Before: `feat(CAPS): desc` → **PASSED** (should fail)
- ✅ After: `feat(CAPS): desc` → **FAILED** (correctly)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Regex Pattern

**Before:**
```regex
^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\(.+\))?!?: .{1,}
```

**Issues with old pattern:**
- `\(.+\)` - Allows any characters in scope (spaces, special chars, uppercase)
- ` .{1,}` - Allows multiple spaces and single-char descriptions

**After:**
```regex
^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\([a-z0-9_/-]+\))?!?: [a-z].{2,}$
```

**Improvements:**
- `\([a-z0-9_/-]+\)` - Scope limited to lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens, underscores, slashes
- `: ` - Exactly one space required after colon
- `[a-z].{2,}` - Description must start with lowercase letter and be at least 3 chars total
- `$` - Anchors at end to prevent trailing content

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages

Added detailed requirements and common mistakes to the validation error output:

```
Requirements:
  • Type must be lowercase
  • Scope (optional) must be lowercase, alphanumeric with -/_
  • Must have exactly ONE space after the colon
  • Description must start with lowercase letter
  • Description must be at least 3 characters

Common mistakes:
  ❌ feat: a (description too short)
  ❌ feat:  double space (multiple spaces)
  ❌ Feat: capitalized type
  ❌ feat: Add (capitalized description)
  ❌ feat(Bad Scope): invalid scope
```

### 3. Updated CONTRIBUTING.md

- Added explicit "Requirements" section
- Added "Common Mistakes" section with examples
- Clarified that description must be meaningful (3+ chars)
- Documented scope character restrictions

### 4. Added Comprehensive Test Suite

Created `test-pr-title-validation.sh` with 35 test cases covering:
- 17 valid PR title formats
- 18 invalid PR title formats
- All edge cases that were previously bugs

## Validation Results

All 35 test cases pass:
- ✅ 17 valid titles correctly accepted
- ✅ 18 invalid titles correctly rejected
- ✅ 0 incorrect validations

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
1. All PR titles strictly follow Conventional Commits specification
2. Release notes will have consistent, high-quality commit messages
3. Automated tooling can reliably parse commit types and scopes
4. Contributors get clear, actionable error messages when validation fails

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/validate-commits.yml` - Updated regex and error messages
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Added requirements and common mistakes sections
3. `.github/workflows/test-pr-title-validation.sh` - New test suite (35 tests)
