# MQTT LED Control Example

This example demonstrates how to control an LED remotely using MQTT messages with the ksIotFrameworkLib IoT library.

## üìã Overview

The MQTT LED example shows how to build a simple IoT device that can be controlled remotely via MQTT. The device connects to a WiFi network and an MQTT broker, then listens for commands to turn an LED on or off. This is a foundational pattern for building more complex IoT devices that respond to cloud commands.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Remote LED Control**: Turn the LED on/off via MQTT messages
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Automatic connection and reconnection
- **MQTT Integration**: Subscribes to control topics and responds to commands
- **Web Configuration**: Easy setup through Access Point mode
- **Persistent Settings**: WiFi and MQTT credentials stored in non-volatile memory
- **Automatic Fallback**: Switches to configuration mode if connection fails

## üîß Hardware Setup

### Requirements

- ESP8266 or ESP32 development board
- LED with current-limiting resistor (220-330Œ©)
- USB cable for programming

### Wiring

```text
ESP Board          LED
GPIO 2 ------------|>|---[220Œ©]--- GND
(or pin in board.h)
```

**Note**: Many ESP development boards have a built-in LED on GPIO 2, so no external LED may be needed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Build and Flash

```bash
cd examples/mqtt-led
pio run -e esp8266dev --target upload  # For ESP8266
# or
pio run -e esp32 --target upload       # For ESP32
```

### 2. Initial Configuration

On first boot, the device has no saved configuration and will automatically enter configuration mode:

1. **Connect to WiFi**: Look for a network named `MqttLed-XXXX` (where XXXX is a unique device identifier)
2. **Open Configuration Page**: Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1` in your web browser
3. **Configure Settings**:
   - **WiFi SSID**: Your WiFi network name
   - **WiFi Password**: Your WiFi password
   - **MQTT Address**: Your MQTT broker address (e.g., `mqtt.example.com` or `192.168.1.100`)
   - **MQTT Port**: MQTT broker port (default: 1883)
   - **MQTT Username**: (Optional) MQTT username if required
   - **MQTT Password**: (Optional) MQTT password if required
   - **MQTT Topic Prefix**: Prefix for MQTT topics (e.g., `home/led1`)
4. **Save Configuration**: Click save - the device will reboot and connect

### 3. Control the LED

Once configured, the device will:

- Connect to your WiFi network
- Connect to the MQTT broker
- Subscribe to the topic: `<prefix>/led`

**To control the LED**, publish messages to this topic:

```bash
# Turn LED on
mosquitto_pub -h mqtt.example.com -t "home/led1/led" -m "on"

# Turn LED off
mosquitto_pub -h mqtt.example.com -t "home/led1/led" -m "off"
```

Replace `home/led1` with your configured MQTT prefix.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Application Architecture

The firmware uses an **application rotator** pattern with two applications:

#### 1. MqttLedApp (Primary Mode)

- Connects to WiFi using saved credentials
- Connects to MQTT broker using saved settings
- Subscribes to `<prefix>/led` topic
- Listens for "on" and "off" commands
- Controls the LED based on received messages
- If connection fails, rotates to ConfigApp

#### 2. ConfigApp (Configuration Mode)

- Creates a WiFi Access Point named "MqttLed-XXXX"
- Hosts a web server at `192.168.4.1`
- Provides a configuration interface for:
  - WiFi SSID and password
  - MQTT broker address, port, and credentials
  - MQTT topic prefix
- Saves configuration to non-volatile storage
- Reboots device after saving

### Component Interaction

```text
MqttLedApp
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ksWifiConnector (handles WiFi connection)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ksMqttConnector (handles MQTT connection)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ onConnected event ‚Üí subscribes to "led" topic
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ onDeviceMessage event ‚Üí controls LED
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ksLed (controls physical LED)
```

### MQTT Message Flow

1. Device connects to MQTT broker
2. Device subscribes to `<prefix>/led` topic
3. User publishes message to topic:
   - `"on"` ‚Üí LED turns on
   - `"off"` ‚Üí LED turns off
4. Device processes message in `onMqttMessage()` callback
5. LED state is updated via `ksLed` component

```

### Key Files Explained

#### `board.h`

Defines the hardware pin configuration:

```cpp
#define LED_PIN 2  // Change this to match your LED pin
```

#### `main.cpp`

Sets up the application rotator:

- Tries `MqttLedApp` first (normal operation)
- Falls back to `ConfigApp` if connection fails

#### `MqttLedApp` (Main Application)

The primary application that:

- Manages WiFi and MQTT connections
- Subscribes to control topics
- Handles incoming MQTT messages
- Controls the LED hardware

Key methods:

- `init()`: Sets up components and registers callbacks
- `onMqttConnected()`: Subscribes to topics when MQTT connects
- `onMqttMessage()`: Processes incoming MQTT commands
- `loop()`: Main execution loop (delegated to framework)

#### `ConfigApp` (Configuration Application)

The configuration interface that:

- Creates an Access Point
- Hosts a web configuration page
- Saves settings to persistent storage
- Uses the framework's built-in `ksMqttConfigProvider`

## üîß Configuration

### MQTT Topic Structure

The device uses a prefix-based topic structure:

```text
<configured_prefix>/led
```

For example, if you set the prefix to `home/livingroom`, the LED control topic will be:

```text
home/livingroom/led
```

### Accepted Commands

Only two commands are recognized:

- `"on"` - Turn LED on (case-sensitive)
- `"off"` - Turn LED off (case-sensitive)

Any other messages are ignored.
