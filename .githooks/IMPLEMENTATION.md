# Commit Hook Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the commit hook implementation for the ksIotFrameworkLib repository.

## What Was Implemented

A Git commit-msg hook that validates commit messages to ensure they follow the repository's standardized format.

## Files Added

1. **`.githooks/commit-msg`** - The main hook script that validates commit messages
2. **`.githooks/install-hooks.sh`** - Installation script to set up the hook
3. **`.githooks/README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation for the hooks
4. **`.githooks/TESTING.md`** - Test cases and validation results

## Features

### ✅ Validation

- Validates commit message format: `(type) description #issue_number`
- Ensures commit type is one of: feat, fix, docs, chore, perf, refactor, test
- Prevents empty descriptions
- Automatically skips merge and revert commits

### ✅ Smart Suggestions

- Analyzes commit message content to suggest appropriate types
- Keywords like "add", "implement" → suggests `(feat)`
- Keywords like "fix", "resolve" → suggests `(fix)`
- Keywords like "doc", "README" → suggests `(docs)`
- And more...

### ✅ User-Friendly Output

- Color-coded messages (red for errors, green for success, yellow for warnings)
- Clear error descriptions
- Helpful examples
- Suggested corrections

### ⚠️ Warnings

- Warns about generic messages like "WIP", "Initial plan", "Fixed stuff"
- Allows the commit but encourages better descriptions

## Installation

Users can install the hook by running:

```bash
./.githooks/install-hooks.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
cp .githooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

## Example Usage

### ❌ Invalid - Missing Type
```bash
git commit -m "added feature"
# Output: Error with suggestion to use "(feat) added feature"
```

### ❌ Invalid - Wrong Type
```bash
git commit -m "(wrong) add feature"
# Output: Error listing valid types with smart suggestion
```

### ✅ Valid
```bash
git commit -m "(feat) add WiFi reconnection logic"
# Output: ✓ Commit message format is valid
```

### ✅ Valid with Issue Reference
```bash
git commit -m "(fix) resolve memory leak in MQTT connector #123"
# Output: ✓ Commit message format is valid
```

### ⚠️ Warning
```bash
git commit -m "(chore) WIP"
# Output: Warning about generic message but allows commit
```

## Integration with Release Workflow

The commit hook ensures that commit messages follow the format expected by the repository's automated release workflow (`.github/workflows/bump-and-release.yml`), which:

- Parses commit messages by type
- Groups commits into release note categories (Features, Fixes, Documentation, etc.)
- Generates semantic version tags

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All commits follow the same format
2. **Better Release Notes** - Automated categorization of changes
3. **Clear History** - Easy to understand what each commit does
4. **Developer Guidance** - Immediate feedback on commit message quality
5. **No Manual Enforcement** - Automatic validation at commit time

## Testing

The hook has been tested with:
- ✅ Valid formats with all commit types
- ✅ Invalid formats (missing type, wrong format)
- ✅ Invalid types with smart suggestions
- ✅ Empty descriptions
- ✅ Generic messages (WIP, etc.) with warnings
- ✅ Merge commits (automatically allowed)
- ✅ Revert commits (automatically allowed)

All tests pass successfully! See `.githooks/TESTING.md` for detailed test results.

## Documentation Updates

- Updated main `README.md` with Development section
- Added comprehensive hook documentation in `.githooks/README.md`
- Created testing documentation in `.githooks/TESTING.md`

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing commits are not affected
- The hook can be bypassed with `git commit --no-verify` if needed (not recommended)
- Works with standard Git workflows
- Compatible with all Git clients

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for the future:
- Add support for conventional commit scopes: `(type(scope): message)`
- Integrate with CI/CD to validate PR commit messages
- Add pre-push hook to ensure all commits in a branch follow the format
- Support for custom commit types defined in a config file
